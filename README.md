# AI_FOTO

Hi all, this is a machine learning project created by Maureen and me for one of the Stackable Certificates under NUS-ISS. The project aims to develop a self-organizing photo app using deep learning, supervised learning and signal processing technology. 

The photo app helps users organize their inventory better and reduce problems that arise from digital clutter through auto facial recognition, emotional detection, blur detection and image category classification.
